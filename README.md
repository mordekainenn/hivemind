## What is Hivemind?

# Open-source AI engineering team that builds production code while you sleep

**If Claude Code is a _developer_, Hivemind is the _engineering team_.**

Hivemind is a Python orchestrator and React dashboard that turns AI coding agents into a full software engineering team. Give it one prompt — it plans the work, spins up specialist agents in parallel, passes artifacts between them, reviews the output, and commits tested code.

It looks like a project dashboard — but under the hood it has DAG-based task planning, parallel execution, self-healing, artifact flow, code review gates, and proactive memory.

**Ship features, not prompts.**

| Step | | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01** | Describe the feature | *"Add JWT authentication with a login page and protected routes"* |
| **02** | Watch the team work | PM plans → Frontend + Backend + DB work in parallel → Tests → Review |
| **03** | Get production code | Tested, reviewed, committed. Open your IDE and it's already there. |

> **COMING SOON: Template Marketplace** — Download pre-built project DAGs and run them with one click. SaaS starters, API backends, full-stack apps — pick a template and let the team build it.

&nbsp;

| **Works with** | 🤖 Claude Code | 🦞 OpenClaw | 🧪 Codex | ⌨️ Cursor | 🐚 Bash | 🌐 HTTP |

*If it can write code, it's hired.*

&nbsp;

## Hivemind is right for you if

- ✅ You want to **describe a feature once** and get production-ready code back
- ✅ You're tired of **babysitting Claude Code** — typing "continue", fixing context loss, managing files manually
- ✅ You want **parallel execution** — frontend, backend, and tests built simultaneously
- ✅ You want a **code review gate** before anything gets committed
- ✅ You want to **monitor everything from your phone** while lying on the couch
- ✅ You want **self-healing** — when an agent fails, the system fixes it automatically
- ✅ You want **zero extra API costs** — runs on your existing Claude Code subscription

&nbsp;

## ⚡ Features

| | | |
|---|---|---|
| 🧩 **DAG-Based Planning** | Every feature is broken into a dependency-aware task graph. Independent tasks run in parallel; dependent tasks wait for upstream artifacts. | 🔄 **Self-Healing Execution** | Failed tasks are classified by failure type and retried with targeted fixes — not blind restarts. |
| 🔀 **Artifact Flow** | Agents pass typed artifacts (API contracts, schemas, test reports) to downstream agents as structured context. | 🧠 **Proactive Memory** | The orchestrator injects lessons learned from past sessions to prevent repeating the same mistakes. |
| 🛡️ **Code Review Gate** | A reviewer agent checks the combined output for correctness, consistency, and code quality before the final commit. | ⚡ **Smart Concurrency** | Reader agents run in parallel; writer agents are serialized when their file scopes overlap to prevent conflicts. |
| 💰 **Zero Extra Cost** | No API keys needed. Runs directly on your Claude Code CLI subscription. No token charges. | 🔒 **Project Isolation** | Every agent is sandboxed to its project directory. Cross-project file access is blocked at multiple enforcement layers. |
| 📱 **Mobile Dashboard** | Real-time streaming, DAG progress, file diffs, cost analytics — all from your phone. | 🔌 **Circuit Breaker** | SDK client implements circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures when the LLM is overloaded. |

&nbsp;

## Problems Hivemind solves

| Without Hivemind | With Hivemind |
| --- | --- |
| ❌ You ask Claude Code to build a feature. It works on one file at a time, loses context, and you babysit for hours. | ✅ Describe the feature once. The PM breaks it into a DAG, agents build in parallel, reviewer checks quality, code is committed. |
| ❌ For a full-stack feature, you manually coordinate backend → frontend → tests → review. Copy-pasting context between sessions. | ✅ Artifact flow passes API contracts, schemas, and test reports between agents automatically. No copy-pasting. |
| ❌ An agent gets stuck in a loop. You kill it, lose context, start over. | ✅ Self-healing detects stuck agents (5 distinct signals), reassigns, simplifies, or respawns — automatically. |
| ❌ You can't leave your desk. If you walk away, the agent stops or goes off track. | ✅ Monitor from your phone. The dashboard streams everything in real-time. Walk away. Go to the couch. |
| ❌ Agents write buggy code and you only find out after merging. | ✅ Code review gate catches issues before commit. Test engineer validates. Security auditor checks OWASP Top 10. |
| ❌ You pay per token and have no idea what each agent is costing you. | ✅ Cost analytics dashboard tracks token usage per session, per agent, over time. |

&nbsp;

## Why Hivemind is special

Hivemind handles the hard orchestration details correctly.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dependency-aware DAG execution.** | Tasks execute in optimal order. The PM creates a real dependency graph, not a flat list. |
| **Two-phase agent protocol.** | Each agent runs a work phase (tools enabled) followed by a structured summary phase, guaranteeing parseable output. |
| **Active escalation.** | Watchdog monitors 5 stuck signals (text similarity > 85%, no file progress, circular delegation). Triggers reassign → simplify → kill & respawn. |
| **Exponential backoff with circuit breaker.** | Rate limits (429) are caught per-agent with retry strategy. Other agents continue working. |
| **Proactive memory injection.** | Past failures and lessons are injected into agent prompts so the team learns across sessions. |
| **File-scope enforcement.** | Agents can only touch files assigned to their task. Cross-scope writes are blocked at the SDK layer. |
| **Typed artifact contracts.** | Agents communicate via structured `TaskInput → TaskOutput` contracts, not free-form text. |

&nbsp;

## What Hivemind is not

| | |
|---|---|
| **Not a chatbot.** | Agents have jobs, not chat windows. |
| **Not an agent framework.** | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run an engineering team made of them. |
| **Not a workflow builder.** | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Hivemind models engineering teams — with roles, dependencies, artifacts, and quality gates. |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, use Claude Code directly. If you want a team — you need Hivemind. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: NPX (Recommended)

```bash
npx create-hivemind@latest
```

One command. It clones the repo, installs dependencies, builds the frontend, and starts the server.

### Option 2: Git Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohen-liel/hivemind.git
cd hivemind
chmod +x setup.sh restart.sh
./setup.sh
./restart.sh
```

### Option 3: Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohen-liel/hivemind.git
cd hivemind
docker-compose up -d --build
```

> **Requirements:** Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+, Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code && claude login`)

### First Launch

1. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser
2. Enter the **access code** shown in your terminal (or scan the QR code from your phone)
3. Click **"+ New Project"** → select a working directory
4. Choose your team: **Solo**, **Team**, or **Full Team**
5. Type a task and hit **Execute**

That's it. Go lie on the couch.
