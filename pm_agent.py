"""
PM Agent — Project Manager that creates the TaskGraph.

v2: Artifact-aware planning with Memory Agent integration.

The PM Agent's ONLY job is to:
1. Read the project's memory snapshot (if it exists)
2. Understand the user's intent
3. Create a clear Vision
4. Break it into Epics
5. Decompose into specific Tasks with:
   - Dependency wiring (depends_on)
   - Context wiring (context_from)
   - Required artifact types per task
   - File scope for conflict detection
   - Acceptance criteria for verification

The PM does NOT read code, does NOT write code, does NOT commit.
It only creates the structured execution plan (TaskGraph).
